# Titanic-Dataset
Being new to ML, I tried my hands on the famous titanic dataset. Here, we have to train our model from the given and predict
whether a person survived or not. I used 2 models, decision tree and Random Forest.
This was done as a part of the free competition on Kaggle, to understand how Kaggle competition works. I have also uploaded my answer submission here.
